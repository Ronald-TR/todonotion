Using partial names may have side effects if you have too many cards, causing confusion like matching/moving wrong cards. So if you have so many cards, please use a full (or almost full) card name. Moving many cards by tag One more advantage to have tagged cards is that you can move all of them simultaneously by passing a Property value. Using the mvp command you can move many cards by property:\ntodonotion mvp happy -f \u0026quot;To Do\u0026quot; -t \u0026quot;Done\u0026quot; As you can see, -f and -t are \u0026ndash;from \u0026ndash;to. So all cards with happy tag will move from \u0026ldquo;To Do\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Done\u0026rdquo;\nHere you need to specify the lanes to avoid moving done cards for example Listing cards todonotion offers a powerful ls command that allows you to filter by lane, property and title. Also, you can combine all flags, having a powerful filter.\nListing all cards in a specific lane This command will list all Doing cards:\ntodonotion ls -l Doing Listing all cards by tag This command will list all cards that have this specifig Property value in \u0026ldquo;To Do\u0026rdquo;\ntodonotion ls -p happy Listing all cards by title matching This command will list all cards in \u0026ldquo;To Do\u0026rdquo; that have the word \u0026ldquo;task\u0026rdquo; in their titles.\ntodonotion ls -t task Combining the flags you can combine the flags to empower your ls command, like a filter.\ntodonotion ls -t task -l Done -p happy This command will list only the Done cards tagged as happy and that have task in some part of their titles.\n","description":"Creating cards Creating a new card Creating a new card in a specific lane Creating a new tagged card Moving cards Moving a single card Moving many cards by tag Listing cards Listing all cards in a specific lane Listing all cards by tag Listing all cards by title matching Combining the flags You can have the full usage help by typing todonotion -h or for a specific command typing todonotion \u0026lt;command\u0026gt; -h"},{"id":2,"href":"/todonotion/usage/installation/","title":"Installation","parent":"Usage","content":" Installation Manual Go to releases page and choose the right choice to your platform:\ncurl -LO https://github.com/Ronald-TR/todonotion/releases/download/v0.1.0/todonotion-linux-386.tar.gz tar -xzvf todonotion-linux-386.tar.gz chmod +x todonotion sudo ln -s todonotion /usr/local/bin Using the installation script Or, you can use the default install.sh script (for linux users) that does the installation with one line:\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ronald-TR/todonotion/master/install.sh | bash You can type todonotion -h and you will see the help message:\nA quick way to generate cards that needs to be done without leaving the terminal.
